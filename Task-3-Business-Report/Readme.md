# Business Report and Data Storytelling for Collections Strategy – Geldium

This project translates predictive analytics insights into a clear, business-ready report for Geldium’s Head of Collections. The goal is to support decision-making by identifying high-risk customer segments and proposing actionable strategies to reduce delinquency.

The analysis builds on insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a conceptual predictive modeling framework developed in earlier tasks.

The dataset includes customer demographic and financial attributes such as age, income, credit utilization, missed payments, debt-to-income ratio, and account tenure.

Based on combined EDA and model insights, several high-risk customer segments were identified.

Customers under 30 years of age with two or more missed payments and credit utilization above 50% show significantly higher delinquency risk.

A high debt-to-income ratio (greater than 0.5) consistently correlates with late or missed payments.

Customers with short account tenure (less than 12 months) tend to demonstrate weaker repayment behavior.

These findings highlight three primary risk factors: frequent missed payments, high credit utilization, and unfavorable debt-to-income ratios.

The report summarizes these insights in a simple and stakeholder-friendly format to ensure easy interpretation.

A key insight was converted into a SMART business recommendation to guide operational action.

The selected insight focuses on young customers with multiple missed payments and high credit utilization.

The proposed recommendation is to launch a targeted 6-week SMS outreach campaign for this high-risk segment.

The objective of the campaign is to reduce 30-day delinquency rates by at least 10%.

The recommendation is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant to business goals, and time-bound.

This targeted strategy is cost-effective, scalable, and aligned with Geldium’s objective of improving repayment behavior while maintaining positive customer relationships.

The report also includes ethical and responsible AI considerations to ensure fair and transparent decision-making.

Potential bias risks were identified, particularly related to demographic or historical data imbalances.

Fairness checks are recommended to compare model outcomes across different customer groups.

Logistic regression was chosen for its interpretability, enabling clear explanation of how customer features influence risk predictions.

Model predictions are intended to support, not replace, human judgment in collection decisions.

The intervention strategy is designed to be supportive rather than punitive, focusing on reminders and assistance.

Customer privacy is preserved by using anonymized and secure data practices.

Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure that the model remains accurate and fair over time.

This business report demonstrates how data insights can be converted into practical strategies for collections teams.

It highlights the importance of combining analytics with business context and ethical considerations.

The project showcases skills in data storytelling, business communication, and responsible AI planning.

This work supports Geldium in improving its collections strategy using data-driven and transparent methods.
