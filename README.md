# AI-Driven Credit Risk & Collections Strategy – Geldium

This repository contains a complete analytics workflow for Geldium, covering data analysis, predictive modeling, business reporting, and AI-driven collections strategy design.

## Task 1 

Task 1 focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and risk profiling to assess data quality, detect anomalies, and identify early indicators of customer delinquency.

Key insights include the impact of high credit utilization, repeated missed payments, and unfavorable debt-to-income ratios on default risk.

## Task 2 

Task 2 outlines a conceptual predictive modeling approach using Logistic Regression to classify customers as delinquent or non-delinquent based on financial and behavioral features.

The model design emphasizes interpretability, regulatory friendliness, and fairness while transforming customer data into a risk probability score.

Model evaluation is planned using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC, and fairness checks to ensure reliable and ethical predictions.

## Task 3 

Task 3 translates predictive insights into a business-ready report for the Head of Collections, identifying high-risk customer segments and proposing a SMART, targeted intervention strategy.

A key recommendation is a focused outreach campaign for young customers with high credit utilization and multiple missed payments to reduce delinquency rates.

Ethical and responsible AI principles such as transparency, human oversight, and privacy protection are incorporated into business decision-making.

## Task 4

Task 4 presents a high-level concept for an AI-powered collections system that automates risk scoring, segmentation, and targeted actions while maintaining human-in-the-loop control.

The system includes responsible AI guardrails such as fairness testing, explainable outputs, compliance monitoring, and continuous learning.

Together, these tasks demonstrate how data analysis and AI concepts can be transformed into scalable, ethical, and business-aligned collections strategies.

This project highlights skills in data analytics, predictive modeling design, business communication, and responsible AI planning.
